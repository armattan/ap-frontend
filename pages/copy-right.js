          In principle we want to let the Armattan Productions community be as
          free as possible in sharing their creativity with others. We want to
          be an inspiring place, and a free flow of ideas, designs and
          conversation is an essential element of this. We would like to ask
          everyone to be nice, civil and helpful. We have a few common sense
          rules that we ask you to keep in mind. These especially relate to
          copyrights and keeping Armattan Productions appropriate for a general
          audience.

          On the Armattan Productions portal you can let other people see your

          We live in a culture of re-mix, re-use and mashup but a good rule of
          thumb here is that if a person does not clearly give you the right to
          use their design, invention, logo, text, slogan etc. then you do not
          have the right to use it. If you do obtain work through, for example,
          a Creative Commons attribution license please always give the
          originator of the material credit for their work. Be nice! This sounds
          simple but lots of mistakes happen when people ignore this simple
          rule. We would like everyone to make whatever they like, as this
          technology is one that enables innovation and the possibility to make
          completely new things is unlimited. However, we do take copyright
          seriously and are legally obliged to respond to any copyright
          infringement notices we receive.

          3) Prices in the Gallery The prices displayed in the Gallery part of

          that they are displayed. Armattan Productions reserves the right to
          change its prices in the Gallery without prior notice. Such change
          however will have no effect on orders completed before the posting of
          a new price on the Gallery. We do our best to prevent errors in the
          pricing. However, should an error occur, we are not bound by our offer
          and may cancel the order. Any monies paid related to that order will
          be refunded to you.

          take a dim view of flamers and negativity in general. This is not to
          say that Armattan Productions should be a place where people only say,
          "you are awesome", "no you are awesomer", "no you are awesomest" to
          each other. There should be room for criticism but it should always be
          constructive.
