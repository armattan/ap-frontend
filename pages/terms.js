          If you want to turn your model into reality, you can place an order
          with us to have it manufactured. At a charge of a service price and
          price for the material used for the model, we manufacture the model
          for you (i.e.,CNC cutting services) in our materials and ship it to
          you. You can also order designs by other Armattan Productions users:
          Armattan Productions allows you to browse the Website for designs in
          our Gallery and to place an order for the manufacturing of an
          available design.

        >
          1) Placing an order To order cutting of the design you created or
          another design you found on our Website, you select the design and
          click the order button. Then you can select the quantity of the
          designs you order and the material you want the design to be made of.
          As the next step, we ask you to provide us with information we need
          for the delivery of the product once it is cut. Finally you will be
          redirected to our payment provider’s website to initiate your payment.
          Please be informed that the language to be used during the whole
          ordering process is English.

          2) Unacceptable orders, cancellation of orders by us If a design is
          available through our Website (in the “Gallery” or “My Designs/ My
          Shop” section), the basic assumption is that it can be produced. There
          are however technical or other reasons why Armattan Productions may
          not accept or may cancel your order during the entire ordering
          process, even after our acceptance of your order. Such reasons can be
          for example but not limited to the unfeasibility of the model, the
          infringing feature of your model (see our Notice Take Down Procedure)
          or the destination of the delivery you indicated in your order etc. In
          case we cancel your partial or entire order we will contact you via
          email and at Armattan Productions discretion will issue you store
          credit or a full refund for the cancelled item(s), with the exception
          of counterfeit parts. Counterfeit parts that make it through
          production before being identified as counterfeits will not be shipped
          or refunded. Upon request these parts can be refunded but your account
          will be terminated at that time. You can keep your account or get a
          refund, but you cannot have both. Under no circumstances will
          counterfeit parts be shipped. Think twice before you upload parts you
          know are counterfeits.
